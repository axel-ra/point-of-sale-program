# point-of-sale-program

This program simulates a point-of-sale transaction by taking user input, performing sale calculations, and printing the receipt to the console.

How to use this program?
  1. Input the item number/item ID. It is suggested the input be an integer number. Examples: 1, 23, 456, 7890.
  2. Input the quantity of the previously entered item the customer is purchasing. Examples: 1, 6, 12, 24.
  3. Input the price of the item. The suggested format is a number with two decimal places, i.e. 10.00, 0.95.
  4. If you desire to add another item, input the integer number 1, and repeat steps 1-3. If you desire to print the receipt, input the integer number 2.
